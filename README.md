CyberSentinel v1.4 - CVE Search & Analysis Tool 🔍


🛡️ About CyberSentinel
CyberSentinel is a GUI-based cybersecurity tool built with Python and Tkinter, designed to help security researchers and developers search, filter, and analyze CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) efficiently.

🔹 Fetch real-time CVE data using the NVD API
🔹 Filter vulnerabilities by year (from and to filters)
🔹 View detailed CVE information in a pop-up window
🔹 Export results to CSV for further analysis
🔹 Copy CVE IDs to clipboard with a click
🔹 Dark-themed hacker-style UI 😎

🎯 Features
✅ Real-time CVE Search - Fetch vulnerabilities dynamically via NVD API
✅ Advanced Filtering - Filter CVEs by year range for targeted analysis
✅ CVE Details Pop-up - View in-depth vulnerability information in a separate window
✅ Smooth Performance - Uses multi-threading to keep the UI responsive
✅ CSV Export - Save search results in a structured file for further analysis
✅ Copy to Clipboard - Quickly copy CVE IDs for reports and documentation
✅ Auto-Adjustable UI - Flexible, resizable window with word wrap
✅ Dark-Themed UI - Aesthetic hacker-style interface for a sleek look
